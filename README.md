# Tron-Box
Tronbox User Guide
## Installation
`$ npm install -g tronbox`
## OS requirement
- NodeJS 5.0+
- Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X

## Features
1. Initialize a Customer Tron-Box Project<br>
`$ tronbox init`
<br>

2. Download a Dapp, ex: metacoin-box<br>
`$ tronbox unbox metacoin`
<br>

3. Contract Compiler<br>
`$ tronbox compile`

<br>
To compile for all contracts, select --compile-all.

Optionally, you can select: <br>
--compile-all: Force compile all contracts. <br>
--network save results to a specifict hose network<br>
<br>

## 4. Contract Migration<br>
`$ tronbox migrate`
<br>

This command will invoke all migration scripts within the migrations directory. If your previous migration was successful, `tronbox migrate` will invoke a newly created migration. If there is no new migration script, this command will have no operational effect. Instead, you can use the option `--reset` to restart the migration script.<br> 

`$ tronbox migrate --reset` 
<br>
## 5. Start Console<br>
This will use the default network to start a console. It will automatically connect to a TVM client. You can use `--network` to change this. <br>

`$ tronbox console`<br>

The console supports the `tronbox` command. For example, you can invoke `migrate --reset` in the console. The result is the same as invoking `tronbox migrate --reset` in the command. 
<br>

## Extra Features in TronBox console:<br>

1. All the compiled contracts can be used, just like in development & test, front-end code, or during script migration. <br>

2. After each command, your contract will be re-loaded. After invoking the `migrate--rest` command, you can immediately use the new address and binary.<br>

3. Every returned command's promise will automatically be logged. There is no need to use `then()`, which simplifies the command.<br>

## 6. Testing<br>

To carry out the test, run the following command:<br>

`$ tronbox test`<br>

You can also run the test for a specific fileï¼š<br>

`$ tronbox test ./path/to/test/file.js`<br>
